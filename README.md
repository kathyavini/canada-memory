A mobile-responsive memory card game I wrote to mark the occasion of submitting my application for Canadian PR.

------------------

## How to Play

Click or tap on each Canadian city or territory once and only once to win. Choosing the same card twice resets your score to 0. There are 17 Canada Cards in total.

On desktop you can hover each card to get the location name. On mobile, long press to reveal.
